### Internhacks 2020

In June-July 2020, my team of two software engineers, a UX designer, a PM, and I designed an inclusive mental health application that matches users based on similar idenities. We implemented user authentication, a survey feature, profile setup, login and logout status, and a live chat platform to connect users.

I developed the front and back-end using JavaScript, React, and Firebase. 
Due to security and privacy reasons that involves users' personal email addresses and names, we decided not to deploy the application until we could ensure security. 
I've added pictures from our localhost to this repo to show our work instead!
